Dear Editor, \\

We would be pleased if you consider our manuscript "Lost in translation: On the impact of data coding
on penalized regression with interactions" for publication in Genetics Selection Evolution.  \\

In recent scientific work on genomic prediction, a tendency towards models incorporating gene by gene, or gene by environment interactions can be observed \cite{ober15,jiang15,martini16,perez17}. 
It has been shown that the additive ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction is not affected by data coding \cite{stranden11,martini17}, but that models with products of marker values as additional predictor variables show a sensitivity to changes of the marker coding \cite{he2016does,martini17}.   \\

In our work, we investigate the cause of this loss of invariance to marker coding, in a general setup of penalized regression on polynomials in the predictor variables. Our results are not limited to ridge regression, but for instance also apply to LASSO or to any other penalized regression, and to any type of interaction (GxG or GxE) modeled by products of predictor variables or by covariance matrices given by Hadamard products. \\

Our considerations are relatively brief, and mainly of theoretical nature. However, we consider GSE as the right platform to present our work, since the topic is of high interest in the area of quantitative genetics. In case that you think that our manuscript is too short for a full length paper, we would like to resubmit it as a short communication. \\
%I am looking forward to hearing from you! \\


Yours sincerely, \\

Francisco Rosales \\ \vspace{2cm}
